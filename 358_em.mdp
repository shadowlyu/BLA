title		= Minimization	; Title of run
define      = -DFLEXIBLE    ; 使用柔性水模型而非刚性模型, 这样最陡下降法可进一步最小化能量

; Parameters describing what to do, when to stop and what to save
integrator	= steep		; Algorithm (steep = steepest descent minimization)
emtol		= 1000.0  	; Stop minimization when the maximum force < 10.0 kJ/mol
